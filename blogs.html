                        <p>How I built a Debian-based distro that actually respects the user's time and disk space.</p>
                        <div class="blog-excerpt">
                            <div class="blog-content">
                                <p>I keep an eye on new Debian-based distros regularly, I like to see what people are
                                    building. But honestly? Most of the time it is just another distro with a different
                                    wallpaper and the same bloated software stack. LibreOffice, video editors, audio
                                    studios... do I really need all that out of the box? No. Nobody asked for it, but it
                                    comes pre-installed anyway.</p>
                                <p>That is exactly why I started Zenclora. I wanted a bloat-free, easy-to-use distro
                                    that works for everyone without forcing unnecessary software down your throat. You
                                    install what you need, nothing more.</p>
                                <p>One of the most annoying things about Debian is that many popular packages are not in
                                    the repos. Steam, Spotify, VSCode, Brave... you have to hunt down repos and keys on
                                    the internet. That is a terrible experience especially for newcomers. So I developed
                                    something to fix this.</p>
                                <p>I created shortcut commands that make the whole process instant. Instead of searching
                                    the internet for an hour, you just type: <code>install-brave</code>,
                                    <code>install-steam</code>, <code>install-vscode</code>,
                                    <code>install-spotify</code>, <code>install-flatpak</code>. That is it. Your entire
                                    setup is done in about a minute. On vanilla Debian that would easily take an hour or
                                    more.
                                </p>
                                <p>System management is the same story. Updating everything? <code>sudo update</code>.
                                    Cleaning up unused packages? <code>sudo cleanup</code>. Changing DNS?
                                    <code>sudo change-dns</code>. No digging through config files, no getting lost in
                                    the terminal.
                                </p>
                                <p>In the 2.0 update, I consolidated all these commands under ZPM (Zen Package Manager).
                                    Now you have even more system control commands, package removal support, and some
                                    handy little utilities. Examples: <code>sudo zen install steam</code>,
                                    <code>sudo zen system dns</code>, <code>sudo zen tools formatusb</code>.
                                </p>
                                <p>I usually do not use my own distros because I test them so many times in VMs and live
                                    boots that the fun wears off. But Zenclora was different. I actually used it for a
                                    long time because setting up my whole environment took literally one minute. That
                                    says something.</p>
                                <p>I am trying to do more than just change the wallpaper and slap KDE on Debian. I want
                                    to actually solve problems and make things easier for new users.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>A research project where I tried to see how far you can push system hardening.</p>
                        <div class="blog-excerpt">
                            <div class="blog-content">
                                <p>I asked myself one day: how far can I actually push hardening? Not the standard stuff
                                    everyone does, but really testing the boundaries. In my free time I started a
                                    research project and called it Hardened Slarpx.</p>
                                <p>Heavy mitigations, aggressive hardening, and a strict firewall were the baseline. But
                                    that was not enough for me, I was looking for something different. Beyond the
                                    traditional hardening approach, my goal was this: the system would actively fight
                                    back against attacks and sabotage the attacker's path.</p>
                                <p>I developed two custom modules: <strong>Xennytsu</strong> and
                                    <strong>Poison</strong>.
                                </p>
                                <p>While developing Xennytsu, I thought about it like this: there are certain suspicious
                                    commands that a regular Linux user would never randomly execute. Xennytsu monitors
                                    these and kills the process. It works on a whitelist basis, so it does not touch
                                    normal Linux programs. It runs every 250ms, balancing performance and speed. It is
                                    effective against automated exploits and mid-level attacks, but honestly it is
                                    vulnerable to advanced exploits, very fast exploits, and kernel-level attacks.</p>
                                <p>Poison takes a different approach. It adds random jitters to things like
                                    <code>/dev/random</code> and <code>/dev/urandom</code> during suspicious activity.
                                    Some exploits are very time-dependent, and these small perturbations aim to sabotage
                                    the exploit's timing.
                                </p>
                                <p>The firewall is extremely strict. Only basic protocols like HTTPS, HTTP, and DNS are
                                    allowed. The distro does not support system-level VPN or Tor. This is strict, yes,
                                    but it fundamentally blocks many attacks like C2 and RAT connections. Even if an
                                    attacker gets in, they probably cannot exfiltrate data. The system is also forced to
                                    use Quad9 DNS and only allows known DNS services, so many suspicious domains get
                                    blocked before they can even resolve.</p>
                                <p>Unlike other hardened distros, Slarpx follows a no-logging policy. I disabled command
                                    history and some other logs. Logs might seem important for security, but they are
                                    also a huge advantage for attackers. Logs give away system information and help
                                    attackers choose the right exploit. Let's be honest, how many people actually sit
                                    there analyzing auditd logs to hunt down an attacker? Very few. Xennytsu, Poison,
                                    and the other hardening mechanisms do their job silently. In my opinion, a silent
                                    system is a more secure system because it gives away less information about you.</p>
                                <p>For the next version I am planning to develop a more strict anti-log module at the
                                    userspace level. The goal is to prevent information leakage as much as possible.</p>

                                style="background:rgba(59,130,246,0.1);color:#60a5fa;border-color:rgba(59,130,246,0.2);">OSINT</span>
                        </div>
                        <p>OSINT tools are indispensable for gathering information. Here are the ones I use and
                            recommend the most.</p>
                        <div class="blog-excerpt">
                            <div class="blog-content">
                                <p>Open Source Intelligence is one of the most used disciplines by security researchers
                                    and pentesters. It means collecting information about a target entirely from
                                    publicly available data without any direct access, and with the right tools you can
                                    reach an incredible amount of information.</p>
                                <p>The OSINT tools I use the most are: <strong>Maltego</strong>, which is unmatched in
                                    data correlation and visualization. It is perfect for seeing connections between
                                    targets. The graph-based interface makes it incredibly intuitive to map out
                                    relationships between people, organizations, domains, and IP addresses. You can
                                    write custom transforms or use community-built ones, which expands its capabilities
                                    enormously.</p>
                                <p><strong>theHarvester</strong> is great for collecting email addresses, subdomains,
                                    and host information from various public sources like search engines, PGP key
                                    servers, and the Shodan database. It is lightweight, fast, and perfect for the
                                    initial reconnaissance phase.</p>
                                <p><strong>Shodan</strong> is a search engine that indexes every internet-connected
                                    device. From IoT devices to servers, you can find everything. What makes Shodan
                                    truly powerful is its ability to search by specific banners, ports, protocols, and
                                    even vulnerabilities. You would be surprised how many industrial control systems are
                                    exposed to the internet.</p>
                                <p><strong>SpiderFoot</strong> is very powerful for automated OSINT collection. It can
                                    scan hundreds of data sources and correlate the findings automatically. Its modular
                                    architecture means you can add new data sources easily.</p>
                                <p><strong>Recon-ng</strong> has a modular structure similar to Metasploit. It provides
                                    a familiar interface for anyone who has used Metasploit, with workspaces, modules,
                                    and reporting capabilities built in.</p>
                                <p><strong>OSINT Framework</strong> is a web-based resource collection where you can
                                    quickly reach the tool you need. It categorizes OSINT resources by type.</p>
                                <p><strong>Google Dorking</strong>, yes, Google itself is a tremendous OSINT tool. With
                                    the right queries you can reach sensitive information like exposed documents, login
                                    pages, configuration files, and database dumps. Operators like site:, filetype:,
                                    inurl:, and intitle: are incredibly powerful when combined correctly.</p>
                                <p>And finally <strong>Censys</strong>, similar to Shodan but more academically focused,
                                    very useful for certificate and host searches. When you use these tools together,
                                    you can create a comprehensive target profile. But remember, OSINT is not just about
                                    collecting data, it is about correctly analyzing it.</p>

                            <h3>Is AI Killing Cybersecurity?</h3>
                            <span class="tag"
                                style="background:rgba(59,130,246,0.1);color:#60a5fa;border-color:rgba(59,130,246,0.2);">AI</span>
                        </div>
                        <p>AI is becoming a double-edged sword in the security world. Let's talk about where it helps
                            and where it hurts.</p>
                        <div class="blog-excerpt">
                            <div class="blog-content">
                                <p>AI keeps getting better at both attacking and defending systems. On the defense side
                                    LLMs can analyze logs and detect anomalies faster than any human team. They can
                                    correlate events across millions of log entries, identify patterns that would take
                                    analysts hours, and generate incident reports in seconds. On the attack side they
                                    can generate phishing emails that are nearly indistinguishable from real ones, find
                                    vulnerabilities at scale, and even write custom malware.</p>
                                <p>What concerns me most is that AI lowers the barrier of entry for attackers
                                    dramatically. You no longer need deep technical knowledge to launch sophisticated
                                    attacks, an LLM can walk you through it step by step. Script kiddies now have access
                                    to nation-state level sophistication. This was not possible even two years ago and
                                    it
                                    changes the entire threat landscape.</p>
                                <p>On the other hand AI is also creating new jobs and roles. Prompt engineering for
                                    security, AI red teaming, and model auditing are becoming real specializations.
                                    Companies
                                    are hiring people specifically to test AI systems for vulnerabilities and biases.
                                    The
                                    field is not dying, it is transforming. People who adapt will thrive but those
                                    sticking to the old ways will struggle.</p>
                                <p>I have seen tools like GitHub Copilot generate code with obvious security flaws,
                                    SQL injections, hardcoded credentials, and missing input validation. Developers
                                    blindly
                                    accepting AI-generated code without review is creating a whole new class of
                                    vulnerabilities. The irony is that AI is both the problem and the potential
                                    solution.</p>
                                <p>The real danger is not AI replacing humans, it is humans blindly trusting AI. AI
                                    hallucinates, makes mistakes, and can be manipulated through prompt injection and
                                    adversarial attacks. If we remove human oversight from the security pipeline, we are
                                    building a house of cards. The winners will be the ones who learn to use AI as a
                                    force multiplier while maintaining critical thinking and manual verification.</p>

                            <h3>Best Pentesting Linux Distros?</h3>
                            <span class="tag"
                                style="background:rgba(59,130,246,0.1);color:#60a5fa;border-color:rgba(59,130,246,0.2);">Linux</span>
                        </div>
                        <p>My personal ranking and honest opinions on the most popular pentesting distros out there.</p>
                        <div class="blog-excerpt">
                            <div class="blog-content">
                                <p>My ranking: 4-BackBox, 3-Kali, 2-Parrot, 1-Pentoo.</p>
                                <p>BackBox looks clean and nice, and its built-in anonymous mode is pretty cool. But it
                                    does not seem very actively maintained these days, which is a big downside if you
                                    need up-to-date tools.</p>
                                <p>Kali is the standard, everyone knows it. It is solid, well-maintained, and has the
                                    largest tool collection. Honestly not much to criticize, it just works. If you are
                                    starting out, Kali is fine.</p>
                                <p>Parrot OS is hands down my favorite and I used it for a very long time. Anonsurf is
                                    fantastic, the software selection is great, and it is incredibly stable. Unlike
                                    Kali, you do not have to deal with constant breakage and update issues. It just
                                    works without drama.</p>
                                <p>Pentoo is my absolute favorite by a wide margin. Hardened Pentoo is both secure and
                                    powerful. I love the customization flexibility that comes from Gentoo. The
                                    installers remove Gentoo's notoriously complicated installation process. It does not
                                    come bloated with software you will never use, you just pull the pentest tools you
                                    actually need from the repos. Clean and efficient.</p>
                                <p>One thing I want to mention is that the distro you use for pentesting matters less
                                    than your actual skills. I have seen people obsess over which distro to use instead
                                    of actually learning the methodology. Any of these distros will give you the tools,
                                    but the knowledge has to come from you. Start with whichever feels comfortable and
                                    focus on understanding what the tools actually do under the hood.</p>

                            <span class="tag"
                                style="background:rgba(59,130,246,0.1);color:#60a5fa;border-color:rgba(59,130,246,0.2);">Networking</span>
                        </div>
                        <p>My experience trying Lokinet on both Debian and Windows, and why it has potential.</p>
                        <div class="blog-excerpt">
                            <div class="blog-content">
                                <p>When I tried to install it on Debian I noticed the repo had not been signed in a long
                                    time. I installed it anyway and wanted to try it out. I replaced the network
                                    interface with Lokinet's to use it at the system level. After a lot of tinkering I
                                    managed to ping .loki sites and it worked.</p>
                                <p>However I could not use exit nodes. I tried exit.loki but it did not work. On Windows
                                    it did not work at all, and I think they might have dropped Windows support in
                                    recent updates.</p>
                                <p>I think the biggest advantage of Lokinet is the ability to rent exit nodes. Most
                                    sites and popular social media platforms now block Tor or hit you with endless
                                    CAPTCHAs and extra verification. If the network were more active and updated more
                                    frequently I would definitely rent an exit node.</p>
                                <p>The biggest advantage over Tor is that it can anonymize traffic beyond just TCP. That
                                    is a significant technical advantage that Tor simply cannot match due to its design
                                    constraints. UDP, ICMP, everything goes through Lokinet. This opens up possibilities
                                    for VoIP, gaming, and other latency-sensitive applications that simply do not work
                                    over Tor.</p>
                                <p>The underlying technology, Oxen's service node network, is interesting because node
                                    operators have a financial incentive to keep their nodes running and performing
                                    well.
                                    This is a fundamentally different model from Tor where relay operators are
                                    volunteers.
                                    Whether this leads to a more reliable network long-term remains to be seen, but the
                                    concept is sound.</p>
                                <p>If Lokinet gets more active development and better documentation, I think it could
                                    become a real alternative to Tor for many use cases. Right now it is still too rough
                                    around the edges for daily use, but I am keeping an eye on it.</p>

                            <span class="tag"
                                style="background:rgba(59,130,246,0.1);color:#60a5fa;border-color:rgba(59,130,246,0.2);">Linux</span>
                        </div>
                        <p>If you are new to Linux, these are the distros I honestly think will give you the best first
                            experience.</p>
                        <div class="blog-excerpt">
                            <div class="blog-content">
                                <p>My recommendations: 1-Pop!_OS, 2-Linux Mint, 3-Sparky Linux, 4-Zorin OS, 5-Big Linux.
                                </p>
                                <p>In my opinion the single biggest thing that makes Linux easy for new users is
                                    software stores. With these distros you can do almost everything without ever
                                    touching the command line. You open the store, search for the app, click install.
                                    Done. Just like you would on Windows or macOS.</p>
                                <p>Pop!_OS stands out with its excellent driver support especially for NVIDIA users.
                                    Linux Mint feels like a comfortable home for Windows users. Sparky is impressively
                                    lightweight yet full-featured. Zorin feels polished and premium. Big Linux is great
                                    if you want something that works well out of the box with wide language support.</p>
                                <p>The key is: do not start with Arch. Do not start with Gentoo. Start with something
                                    that lets you actually use your computer while you learn Linux at your own pace. You
                                    can always switch to more advanced distros later when you actually understand what
                                    you are doing and why.</p>
                                <p>I also want to add: do not let anyone tell you that you are not a "real Linux user"
                                    because you use a beginner-friendly distro. That gatekeeping is toxic. Ubuntu, Mint,
                                    Pop are all perfectly valid daily drivers. I know people who have been using Mint
                                    for
                                    years and are more productive than people who spend all day tweaking their Arch
                                    config. Use whatever works for you and makes you productive.</p>

                            distros.</p>
                        <div class="blog-excerpt">

                                <p>My ranking: 1-Garuda, 2-Bazzite, 3-Pop!_OS, 4-Nobara.</p>
                                <p>The distro I used the longest was Garuda. I played many games on it and had zero
                                    issues. In World of Warcraft Cata Classic I actually got more FPS than on Windows! I
                                    installed the Gaming Edition and the Zen kernel provided a clearly noticeable FPS
                                    boost. Driver support is already excellent on Garuda. The Chaotic-AUR gives you
                                    access to pre-built AUR packages which means you do not have to compile everything
                                    from source, huge time saver.</p>
                                <p>I also used Nobara. Performance was good and it has kernel-level customizations, but
                                    the updates were always problematic for me. Nobara's update process just did not
                                    work well, updates would take hours and sometimes break things. I could not tolerate
                                    that for long. That said, GloriousEggroll's work on Proton-GE is incredible and
                                    Nobara benefits from that directly.</p>
                                <p>Pop!_OS is not as performant as the others gaming-wise, but it wins on ease of use.
                                    If you just want to game without fiddling with settings, it is a solid choice.
                                    System76's NVIDIA driver integration is probably the best in the Linux world, which
                                    matters a lot for gaming.</p>
                                <p>I did not spend much time with Bazzite, but from what I saw the performance and ease
                                    of use look promising. It is a relatively new distro but it is rapidly gaining a
                                    good reputation in the Linux gaming community. The immutable base means you
                                    basically cannot break your system, which is great if you like to tinker.</p>
                                <p>Now let me talk about the gaming ecosystem in general. Proton and Wine have come
                                    an incredibly long way. Five years ago playing AAA titles on Linux was a dream, now
                                    it is basically plug and play for most games. Valve's investment in Proton through
                                    the Steam Deck has been the single biggest contribution to Linux gaming ever. The
                                    compatibility layer handles DirectX to Vulkan translation, Windows API calls, and
                                    even some anti-cheat integration transparently.</p>
                                <p>Speaking of anti-cheat, this is still the biggest pain point. EasyAntiCheat and
                                    BattlEye have Linux support but many game developers simply do not enable it.
                                    Games like Fortnite, Valorant, and PUBG still do not work on Linux because of
                                    kernel-level anti-cheat requirements. This is frustrating but slowly improving.</p>
                                <p>For getting the most performance out of your system, here are my tips: use the
                                    Zen or Liquorix kernel instead of the generic one. Enable GameMode by Feral
                                    Interactive, it automatically tunes your system when a game launches. Use
                                    MangoHud for an FPS overlay and performance monitoring. Install Lutris for
                                    managing non-Steam games, it handles all the Wine configuration for you.
                                    And if you have an NVIDIA card, always use the proprietary drivers, the
                                    open-source nouveau drivers are not good enough for gaming.</p>
                                <p>One last thing: if you are dual-booting, keep a separate partition for your
                                    games. You can actually mount your Windows NTFS game partition from Linux and
                                    play some games directly from there without re-downloading. This saved me
                                    hundreds of gigabytes of disk space.</p>

                        <p>My honest reviews of the browsers I have actually used daily.</p>
                        <div class="blog-excerpt">
                            <div class="blog-content">
                                <p><strong>Brave:</strong> Despite losing points for the ads and crypto nonsense, I
                                    think Brave captures the best balance between daily usability and security. Though
                                    the Chrome dependency is still a big negative.</p>
                                <p><strong>Firefox:</strong> A basic and classic browser. I do not have strong opinions
                                    on it. For security I would not choose it as-is, LibreWolf is a better alternative
                                    with better defaults out of the box.</p>
                                <p><strong>Zen Browser:</strong> Clean, simple, and I like it. Not bad on the security
                                    front either, though it requires some manual configuration to get the most out of
                                    it. Great for people who want a minimal browsing experience.</p>
                                <p><strong>Chrome:</strong> The sync feature is incredible, I used Chrome for a very
                                    long time. Especially if you switch distros every week like me, just sign into your
                                    Google account and all your bookmarks and passwords are right where you left them.
                                    But from a security perspective, Chrome is a complete disaster. Ublock Origin is no
                                    longer supported, and performance-wise it is terrible. RAM hog too.</p>
                                <p><strong>Opera GX:</strong> I used it for a while. I liked the interface aesthetics
                                    but security-wise it is mid at best. Performance was bad, lots of freezing and
                                    crashes. RAM usage was also excessive. Hard to recommend.</p>
                                <p>Overall, I think the browser landscape is frustrating. The Chromium monopoly means
                                    Google effectively controls web standards. Firefox-based browsers are the only real
                                    alternative engine, but they keep losing market share. If Firefox dies, we are stuck
                                    with a Google-controlled web. That is why I try to support Firefox-based browsers
                                    even when Chromium-based ones are technically more convenient. Competition matters.
                                </p>
                                <p>My current daily setup: Brave for general browsing with shields up, and a hardened
                                    Firefox profile for anything sensitive. I keep them separate on purpose. Browser
                                    fingerprinting is real and using the same browser for everything makes tracking
                                    trivially easy. Compartmentalization is key.</p>

                        <p>Why you should stop installing random free VPNs and what you should use instead.</p>
                        <div class="blog-excerpt">
                            <div class="blog-content">
                                <p>Please stop downloading VPNs with names like "Super Duper Mega Fast VPN" on your
                                    phones. These free VPN apps are not protecting you, they are harvesting your data.
                                    Your browsing history, your DNS queries, your traffic metadata, all of it gets
                                    collected and sold. You are not the customer, you are the product.</p>
                                <p>If you need a VPN, my top recommendation is Mullvad VPN. They accept anonymous
                                    payments, do not require an email to sign up, and have been independently audited.
                                    After Mullvad, ProtonVPN is a solid second choice with a usable free tier that
                                    actually respects your data.</p>
                                <p>The fundamental rule is simple: if a VPN service is free and seems too good to be
                                    true, it probably is. Running VPN infrastructure costs money: servers, bandwidth,
                                    maintenance, legal compliance. If they are not charging you, someone else is paying,
                                    and that someone wants your data in return.</p>
                                <p>I also want to mention: even paid VPNs are not magic privacy tools. Your VPN provider
                                    can still see your traffic. You are essentially shifting trust from your ISP to the
                                    VPN provider. So choose one that has been independently audited and has a proven
                                    track
                                    record. Mullvad has been raided by police and had nothing to hand over because they
                                    genuinely do not log. That is the level of trust you should be looking for.</p>
                                <p>And no, you do not need a VPN for everything. If you are just browsing the web
                                    normally, HTTPS already encrypts your traffic. A VPN is useful for hiding your
                                    traffic
                                    from your ISP, bypassing geo-restrictions, or when using untrusted networks like
                                    public WiFi. Stop treating it as a magical security shield because it is not.</p>

                        <p>AI can write code, generate images, but music? Not quite there yet in my opinion.</p>
                        <div class="blog-excerpt">
                            <div class="blog-content">
                                <p>I can immediately tell whether a beat was generated by AI because it still produces
                                    this weird subtle tonal quality. No matter what genre you make or how detailed your
                                    prompt is, a careful listener will absolutely notice it is AI-generated.</p>
                                <p>The technology is getting better fast, but right now AI music lacks soul. It can
                                    mimic patterns and structures, but it cannot capture the feel that makes a track
                                    truly slap. It is too perfect in the wrong way, too sterile. Real music has
                                    imperfections that give it character.</p>
                                <p>Maybe in a few years this will change, but today? If you are producing music and
                                    relying entirely on AI, people who actually listen carefully will notice. Use it as
                                    a starting point or for inspiration maybe, but do not pass it off as your own craft.
                                </p>
                                <p>Where I think AI music tools actually shine right now is in background music and
                                    sound design. Ambient tracks, lo-fi beats, game soundtracks, things where the
                                    listener
                                    is not paying close attention to every note. For that, AI is genuinely useful and
                                    saves
                                    a lot of time. But for a song that is meant to be listened to actively and enjoyed,
                                    we are still far from replacing human musicians.</p>
                                <p>The ethical side is also messy. AI models are trained on copyrighted music without
                                    the artists' consent. The whole discourse around AI art applies here too. I think we
                                    need better regulations and transparency about what data these models are trained on
                                    before the technology matures further.</p>

                                    unlike Linux, there are far fewer guide videos and articles out there to help you
                                    troubleshoot.</p>
                                <p>But overall? It was very fast and clean. I genuinely liked it.</p>
                                <p>The big problem: I could not install any of the apps I regularly use. Steam, Discord,
                                    VSCode, Brave, GitHub Desktop... none of them. It is still not as compatible as
                                    Linux in terms of application support, and I think that is BSD's biggest weakness
                                    right now. There are apparently some compatibility tools that can run Linux apps on
                                    BSD but I was too lazy to bother with them.</p>
                                <p>That said, it was fine for basic usage. I browsed the internet with Firefox, watched
                                    YouTube videos, no issues. The stability was incredible, when I used it GhostBSD was
                                    based on FreeBSD stable (I think it has moved to a rolling model now).</p>
                                <p>I used it for a full month without a single crash or issue. It was a nice experience.
                                    FreeBSD is evolving really fast and I hope it gets better app support and becomes
                                    more user-friendly in the future.</p>
                                <p>One thing I really appreciated was the documentation. FreeBSD and its derivatives
                                    have some of the best documentation in the entire open-source world. The FreeBSD
                                    Handbook is legendary for a reason. When I ran into issues, the official docs almost
                                    always had the answer. Linux distributions could learn a lot from this approach.</p>
                                <p>Would I daily drive BSD? Honestly, not yet. Not because the OS is bad, it is great,
                                    but because my workflow depends on too many Linux-specific applications. If I were
                                    running a server or a network appliance though, FreeBSD would absolutely be on my
                                    shortlist. The jails system alone is worth considering as an alternative to Docker
                                    containers.</p>

                        <p>Veracrypt is an open-source disk encryption tool with plausible deniability features.</p>
                        <div class="blog-excerpt">
                            <div class="blog-content">
                                <p>Veracrypt is the successor to TrueCrypt and honestly one of the best encryption tools
                                    available. It supports AES, Serpent, and Twofish encryption algorithms, and you can
                                    even cascade them for paranoid-level security. It works on Windows, macOS, and
                                    Linux.</p>
                                <p>The standout feature is hidden volumes. You can create a hidden encrypted volume
                                    inside another encrypted volume. Even if someone forces you to reveal your password,
                                    you give them the outer volume password. They see decoy files and have no way to
                                    prove the hidden volume even exists. That is plausible deniability at its finest.
                                </p>
                                <p>Full disk encryption, encrypted containers, and portable mode are all supported. If
                                    you are carrying sensitive data on a USB drive, there is really no excuse not to use
                                    it. Setup is straightforward and the documentation is excellent.</p>
                                <p>I personally use Veracrypt for my external drives. The peace of mind knowing that
                                    if I lose a USB stick, nobody can access the data on it, is worth the few extra
                                    seconds it takes to mount the volume. You can also create encrypted file containers
                                    that look like normal files, which is great for storing sensitive documents
                                    alongside
                                    regular files without drawing attention.</p>
                                <p>The performance impact is minimal on modern hardware. AES encryption is hardware
                                    accelerated on most CPUs released in the last decade, so you will barely notice any
                                    slowdown. If you are not encrypting your portable storage in 2026, you are taking an
                                    unnecessary risk.</p>

                        <div class="blog-excerpt">
                            <div class="blog-content">
                                <p>People sell or give away their old laptops and desktops all the time without properly
                                    wiping the data. A simple format from Windows does not actually erase your files, it
                                    just marks the space as available. Anyone with basic data recovery tools can pull
                                    your photos, documents, passwords, and browser history from that drive.</p>
                                <p>Before selling any device, you should use a proper disk wiping tool. DBAN (Darik's
                                    Boot and Nuke) is free and does the job. For SSDs, use the manufacturer's secure
                                    erase tool since DBAN is designed for HDDs. Or better yet, use full disk encryption
                                    before you even start using the drive. That way even if someone recovers the data,
                                    it is encrypted garbage without the key.</p>
                                <p>This might sound paranoid but identity theft from sold devices is more common than
                                    people think. Take the extra 30 minutes to properly wipe your data. It could save
                                    you months of headaches dealing with compromised accounts and stolen identity.</p>
                                <p>Do not forget about smartphones either. A factory reset on most phones does not
                                    fully erase data. Use the built-in encryption before factory resetting, this ensures
                                    that even if someone recovers the encrypted data, it is useless without the key.
                                    And remove your SIM card and any SD cards before handing the device over.</p>

                                <p>Running an onion service is one thing, keeping it secure and anonymous is another.
                                    The most common attack vectors are DDoS floods and IP leaks through misconfigured
                                    services. Both can completely compromise your operation.</p>
                                <p>For DDoS protection, rate limiting at the Tor configuration level is essential. Use
                                    HiddenServiceMaxStreams and configure connection limits carefully. Vanguards add-on
                                    provides extra guard relay protection. On the server side, configure iptables to
                                    only accept connections from localhost on the service port, this ensures traffic can
                                    only come through Tor.</p>
                                <p>IP leaks are the silent killer. Always bind your service exclusively to 127.0.0.1.
                                    Never use a server that also has clearnet services. DNS leaks, error pages revealing
                                    server info, and application-level leaks in headers are surprisingly common
                                    mistakes. Regularly audit your service with proper OPSEC checklists.</p>
                                <p>One often overlooked aspect is clock skew. Your server's system time can be used as
                                    a fingerprint. If an adversary can correlate your server's clock drift with known
                                    servers, they can narrow down your identity. Use NTP carefully and consider
                                    randomizing timestamps in your application layer.</p>
                                <p>Content-based attacks are also a real threat. If someone uploads a file to your
                                    service that phones home (like an image with tracking pixels or a document that
                                    makes external requests), your real IP could be leaked. Sanitize all user uploads
                                    and strip metadata aggressively.</p>

                                <p>Application isolation is one of the most underrated security practices on Linux.
                                    Firejail and Bubblewrap (bwrap) are two tools that sandbox applications, limiting
                                    what they can see and do on your system.</p>
                                <p>Firejail is the easier option. It comes with hundreds of pre-built profiles for
                                    popular applications. Just prefix any command with <code>firejail</code> and the app
                                    runs in a restricted environment. It uses Linux namespaces, seccomp filters, and
                                    capability dropping. Great for quickly sandboxing browsers, media players, and other
                                    network-facing applications.</p>
                                <p>Bubblewrap is lower-level and more flexible. It is what Flatpak uses under the hood.
                                    You have to manually specify what the sandboxed process can access: which
                                    directories, which devices, which environment variables. It is more work but gives
                                    you precise control. I even built a tool called Plaztek around bwrap for rule-based
                                    isolation.</p>
                                <p>When to use which? Firejail for quick and easy sandboxing with sensible defaults.
                                    Bubblewrap when you need fine-grained control or are building something custom. Both
                                    are infinitely better than running everything with full system access.</p>
                                <p>A practical tip: if you are on a systemd-based distro, you can also use systemd's
                                    built-in sandboxing features like PrivateTmp, NoNewPrivileges, and
                                    ProtectSystem=strict for your services. It is not as flexible as Firejail or bwrap
                                    for desktop apps, but for daemons and background services it is excellent and
                                    does not require any additional packages.</p>

                        <p>Everyone keeps asking about quantum threats. Let me break it down simply.</p>
                        <div class="blog-excerpt">
                            <div class="blog-content">
                                <p>Quantum computing is advancing rapidly and yes, in theory, a sufficiently powerful
                                    quantum computer could break the asymmetric cryptography that Tor and most of the
                                    internet relies on. Shor's algorithm can factor large numbers exponentially faster
                                    than classical computers, which would break RSA and ECC.</p>
                                <p>But here is the thing: we are not there yet. Current quantum computers have nowhere
                                    near enough stable qubits to threaten modern encryption. We are probably 10-20 years
                                    away from that capability, if it even happens on that timeline.</p>
                                <p>The Tor Project and the wider cryptography community are already working on
                                    post-quantum cryptography. NIST has finalized several post-quantum algorithms
                                    (CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium). Tor will eventually migrate to these. The real
                                    question is whether the migration happens fast enough.</p>
                                <p>In the meantime, the "harvest now, decrypt later" attack is the real concern. State
                                    actors could be recording encrypted traffic today with the intention of decrypting
                                    it once quantum computers become viable. That is a legitimate threat for information
                                    that needs to stay secret for decades.</p>
                                <p>What practical steps can you take now? Start transitioning to post-quantum
                                    algorithms where possible. Signal messenger has already implemented post-quantum
                                    key exchange. Libraries like liboqs make it possible to experiment with PQ
                                    cryptography today. For long-term secrets, double-encrypting with both classical
                                    and post-quantum algorithms is a reasonable hedge. The transition will be messy,
                                    but starting early is better than being caught off guard.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>P2P is not dead, it is evolving. Here are my thoughts on where it is heading.</p>
                        <div class="blog-excerpt">
                            <div class="blog-content">
                                <p>P2P networks have been around since the Napster days but they are far from obsolete.
                                    In fact, modern P2P protocols are more sophisticated than ever. IPFS, BitTorrent v2,
                                    and various DHT-based systems are pushing decentralization forward.</p>
                                <p>The core appeal of P2P is resilience and censorship resistance. No single point of
                                    failure, no central authority that can shut things down. This matters more than ever
                                    as internet censorship increases globally.</p>
                                <p>The challenges remain though: NAT traversal is still painful, latency is inherently
                                    higher than centralized systems, and the user experience often suffers. But projects
                                    like I2P, Yggdrasil, and even IPFS are making significant progress.</p>
                                <p>I believe the future of the internet will be a hybrid model: centralized services for
                                    convenience and P2P infrastructure for resilience and freedom. The question is
                                    whether enough people care about decentralization to build and maintain these
                                    networks.</p>
                                <p>Blockchain technology, despite all the hype and scams, has brought one genuinely
                                    useful innovation to P2P: decentralized consensus without a central authority.
                                    Projects like IPFS combined with Filecoin create economic incentives for distributed
                                    storage. Whether this model works long-term is debatable, but the experiment is
                                    worth watching.</p>
                                <p>What excites me most is the potential for P2P AI inference. Instead of relying on
                                    centralized cloud providers for AI, imagine a network where nodes contribute their
                                    GPU power for distributed inference. Projects like Petals are already experimenting
                                    with this. It is early days, but the implications for democratizing AI access are
                                    huge.</p>

                        <p>When disaster strikes and you accidentally delete something important, here is how to get it
                            back on Linux.</p>
                        <div class="blog-excerpt">
                            <div class="blog-content">
                                <p>Data loss happens to everyone eventually. Whether it is an accidental
                                    <code>rm -rf</code>, a corrupted filesystem, or a failing drive, knowing how to
                                    recover data on Linux is an essential skill.
                                </p>
                                <p>The first rule: stop writing to the affected drive immediately. Every write operation
                                    reduces the chance of recovery. Boot from a live USB and work from there. Tools like
                                    <strong>TestDisk</strong> and <strong>PhotoRec</strong> are incredibly powerful and
                                    completely free. TestDisk can recover lost partitions and make non-booting disks
                                    bootable again. PhotoRec ignores the filesystem and carves files directly from the
                                    disk surface.
                                </p>
                                <p>For ext4 filesystems, <code>extundelete</code> can recover recently deleted files if
                                    the journal still has entries. <code>ddrescue</code> is your best friend for failing
                                    hardware since it creates a recoverable disk image while handling read errors
                                    gracefully. Always recover to a different drive, never to the same one.</p>
                                <p>Prevention is better than recovery though. Set up automated backups with rsync,
                                    timeshift, or restic. A backup strategy that you never test is not a backup
                                    strategy.</p>
                                <p>I follow the 3-2-1 backup rule: three copies of your data, on two different types
                                    of media, with one copy offsite. It sounds excessive until you actually need it.
                                    Cloud backup services like Backblaze B2 are dirt cheap and restic supports them
                                    natively with client-side encryption. Your cloud provider never sees your actual
                                    data.</p>
                                <p>One more thing: if you are dealing with a failing SSD, the recovery window is much
                                    shorter than with HDDs. SSDs can fail suddenly and completely due to controller
                                    failures. With an HDD, you usually get warnings like clicking sounds or gradually
                                    increasing bad sectors. Monitor your drive health with smartctl and replace drives
                                    proactively when S.M.A.R.T. attributes start degrading.</p>

                            <div class="blog-content">
                                <p>Fine-tuning is taking a pre-trained model and training it further on your own
                                    specific dataset. Instead of training from scratch, which requires massive compute
                                    and data, you leverage what the model already knows and adapt it to your domain.</p>
                                <p>The process is straightforward conceptually: prepare your dataset in the right format
                                    (usually instruction-response pairs), choose a base model, configure your training
                                    hyperparameters (learning rate, epochs, batch size), and let it train. LoRA and
                                    QLoRA have made this accessible on consumer hardware by only training a small
                                    fraction of the model's weights.</p>
                                <p>The hardest part is actually data quality. Garbage in, garbage out. Your fine-tuned
                                    model will only be as good as your training data. I spent more time cleaning and
                                    formatting my datasets than actually training the models.</p>
                                <p>Tools I use: Hugging Face Transformers, Unsloth for fast training, and Axolotl for
                                    easy configuration. Even with a single GPU you can fine-tune 7B and 13B parameter
                                    models with LoRA in a reasonable timeframe. The results can be surprisingly good for
                                    domain-specific tasks.</p>

                                <p>Ollama makes running LLMs locally incredibly simple. One command to install, one
                                    command to pull a model, one command to start chatting. No cloud, no API keys, no
                                    subscription fees. Everything runs on your machine.</p>
                                <p>You can run models like Llama 3, Mistral, Gemma, and Phi locally. The quality of
                                    smaller models (7B-13B) has improved dramatically. For many tasks they are genuinely
                                    good enough. Coding assistance, text summarization, brainstorming, and even basic
                                    reasoning work well.</p>
                                <p>The hardware requirements depend on the model size. 7B models run comfortably on 8GB
                                    RAM. 13B needs about 16GB. 70B models need serious hardware. GPU offloading makes
                                    everything faster if you have a compatible card.</p>
                                <p>The killer feature is the API compatibility. Ollama exposes an OpenAI-compatible API,
                                    so you can point any tool or library that works with OpenAI to your local Ollama
                                    instance. Complete data privacy with zero cloud dependency. For development and
                                    experimentation this is a game changer.</p>

                        <p>FreeBSD is making big strides in usability and performance. Here is a deep dive into what
                            makes it special.</p>
                        <div class="blog-excerpt">
                            <div class="blog-content">
                                <p>FreeBSD is evolving at an impressive pace. The performance improvements, especially
                                    in networking and storage, are significant. ZFS is a first-class citizen on FreeBSD
                                    and the integration is seamless. Unlike Linux where ZFS is a third-party module due
                                    to licensing conflicts, FreeBSD ships ZFS as part of the base system. This means
                                    better testing, better integration, and fewer headaches.</p>
                                <p>Let me talk about ZFS for a moment because it is genuinely one of FreeBSD's killer
                                    features. Copy-on-write, snapshots, built-in RAID, checksumming, compression,
                                    deduplication... it is like having an enterprise-grade storage solution built right
                                    into your OS. I have seen ZFS catch and correct silent data corruption that would
                                    have gone completely unnoticed on ext4 or XFS. For anyone running a NAS or a server
                                    with important data, ZFS on FreeBSD is the gold standard.</p>
                                <p>The pkg package manager is fast and reliable. The ports collection gives you
                                    incredible flexibility for custom compilation. Where FreeBSD really shines is in
                                    stability, security features like Capsicum and jails, and its networking stack. Many
                                    high-traffic CDNs and hosting providers run FreeBSD for good reason. Netflix, for
                                    example, serves a massive portion of their traffic from FreeBSD-based servers.</p>
                                <p>FreeBSD jails deserve their own discussion. They are essentially lightweight
                                    containers that existed long before Docker was even a concept. A jail creates an
                                    isolated environment with its own filesystem, network stack, users, and processes.
                                    Unlike Linux containers which share the host kernel's namespace mechanism, jails
                                    are deeply integrated into the FreeBSD kernel and are incredibly secure. You can
                                    run untrusted code in a jail without worrying about container escape vulnerabilities
                                    that plague Docker.</p>
                                <p>Capsicum is another security gem. It is a capability-based security framework that
                                    lets you sandbox individual processes at a very granular level. Instead of running
                                    something as root and hoping for the best, you can restrict exactly what system
                                    calls and file descriptors a process can use. Many base system utilities in FreeBSD
                                    already use Capsicum to limit their own privileges.</p>
                                <p>The networking stack in FreeBSD is legendary. The TCP/IP implementation has been
                                    refined over three decades and is arguably the best in any operating system.
                                    Features
                                    like VIMAGE (virtualized network stacks), pf firewall (ported from OpenBSD), and
                                    CARP (Common Address Redundancy Protocol) make FreeBSD an excellent choice for
                                    network appliances and firewalls. pfSense and OPNsense, two of the most popular
                                    open-source firewalls, are both based on FreeBSD.</p>
                                <p>bhyve is FreeBSD's hypervisor, and it has matured significantly. It supports
                                    running Linux, Windows, and other BSDs as guests. Combined with jails for
                                    lightweight
                                    isolation and ZFS for storage management, FreeBSD gives you a complete
                                    virtualization
                                    platform without any third-party tools.</p>
                                <p>DTrace, originally from Solaris, is fully integrated into FreeBSD. It is a dynamic
                                    tracing framework that lets you observe and debug the kernel and userland in
                                    real-time
                                    without stopping the system. You can trace system calls, function entries, I/O
                                    operations, and virtually anything else. For production debugging and performance
                                    analysis, DTrace is unmatched.</p>
                                <p>The main drawback remains software compatibility. Many popular Linux applications do
                                    not have native FreeBSD ports. The Linux compatibility layer helps but it is not
                                    seamless. If you can work within its ecosystem though, FreeBSD rewards you with a
                                    rock-solid, well-documented system. The FreeBSD Handbook is genuinely one of the
                                    best pieces of technical documentation ever written.</p>
                                <p>I honestly believe that if FreeBSD had received the same level of desktop investment
                                    that Linux got through Ubuntu and Android, the computing landscape would look very
                                    different today. The engineering quality is exceptional, it just never had the
                                    marketing push and hardware vendor support that Linux enjoys.</p>

                                <p>Tor encrypts your traffic between your machine and the exit node, but the exit node
                                    decrypts it before sending it to the destination. This means a malicious exit node
                                    can see and modify unencrypted traffic. If you visit an HTTP site through Tor, the
                                    exit node operator sees everything.</p>
                                <p>Exit node attacks include SSL stripping, injecting malicious code into HTTP pages,
                                    credential harvesting, and traffic analysis. Multiple research papers have
                                    documented state-level actors setting up malicious exit nodes at scale.</p>
                                <p>Protection is simple: always use HTTPS. The Tor Browser enforces HTTPS-Only mode by
                                    default. Never transmit sensitive data over unencrypted connections. Be cautious of
                                    certificate warnings. Use end-to-end encrypted communications when possible. The
                                    exit node is the weakest link in the Tor circuit, treat it accordingly.</p>
                                <p>There have been cases where exit node operators modified Bitcoin addresses in
                                    real-time,
                                    replacing the intended recipient's address with their own. This highlights why
                                    end-to-end integrity verification matters. Always verify critical data like wallet
                                    addresses, download checksums, and PGP signatures independently of the transport
                                    layer.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Getting started with iptables and fundamental Linux hardening practices.</p>
                        <div class="blog-excerpt">
                            <div class="blog-content">
                                <p>IPtables is the traditional Linux firewall tool that works at the kernel level. It
                                    uses chains (INPUT, OUTPUT, FORWARD) and rules to filter packets. The basic
                                    philosophy: default deny everything, then explicitly allow only what you need.
                                    Understanding this philosophy is the foundation of all network security.</p>
                                <p>Let me walk through a practical iptables setup. Start with flushing existing rules
                                    and setting default policies:
                                    <code>iptables -F && iptables -P INPUT DROP && iptables -P FORWARD DROP && iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT</code>.
                                    Then allow loopback: <code>iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT</code>.
                                    Allow established connections:
                                    <code>iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT</code>.
                                    Then open only what you need:
                                    <code>iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT</code>
                                    for SSH. This gives you a minimal but functional firewall.
                                </p>
                                <p>For rate limiting SSH brute force attacks, this rule is gold:
                                    <code>iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m recent --set --name SSH</code>
                                    followed by
                                    <code>iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m recent --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 4 --name SSH -j DROP</code>.
                                    This allows only 3 new SSH connections per minute from the same IP. Simple but
                                    incredibly effective against automated attacks.
                                </p>
                                <p>Logging is crucial for monitoring. Add a logging rule before your final DROP:
                                    <code>iptables -A INPUT -j LOG --log-prefix "IPT-DROP: " --log-level 4</code>.
                                    Then you can monitor dropped packets with
                                    <code>tail -f /var/log/kern.log | grep IPT-DROP</code>.
                                    This tells you exactly what is being blocked and helps you identify attack patterns.
                                </p>
                                <p>Start with dropping all incoming traffic by default, then open only the ports your
                                    services need. Allow established connections, stateful filtering is your friend. Log
                                    dropped packets for monitoring. For a server, you typically only need SSH (22), HTTP
                                    (80), and HTTPS (443). Everything else should be blocked.</p>
                                <p>For geo-blocking, you can use ipset with iptables. Download country IP ranges,
                                    create an ipset, and block entire countries you do not expect traffic from. This
                                    dramatically reduces your attack surface. Most automated attacks come from a small
                                    number of countries, blocking those at the firewall level means your services never
                                    even see the malicious traffic.</p>
                                <p>Beyond iptables, basic Linux hardening includes: disabling root SSH login, using
                                    key-based authentication only, keeping packages updated, removing unnecessary
                                    services, configuring automatic security updates, setting proper file permissions,
                                    and using fail2ban for brute-force protection. These simple steps stop the vast
                                    majority of automated attacks.</p>
                                <p>Kernel hardening is also important and often overlooked. Sysctl parameters like
                                    <code>net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1</code> protect against SYN floods.
                                    <code>net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1</code> enables reverse path filtering.
                                    <code>kernel.randomize_va_space = 2</code> enables full ASLR.
                                    <code>fs.protected_hardlinks = 1</code> and <code>fs.protected_symlinks = 1</code>
                                    prevent symlink attacks. These are easy to set and provide significant protection.
                                </p>
                                <p>If you are on a newer system, consider using nftables instead of iptables. It is
                                    the successor and has a cleaner syntax with better performance. The transition is
                                    not difficult if you understand iptables concepts, and most modern distributions
                                    are already using nftables as the backend even when you use iptables commands
                                    through the compatibility layer.</p>
                                <p>For auditing your setup, tools like Lynis are invaluable. Run
                                    <code>lynis audit system</code> and it will scan your entire system for security
                                    issues and give you actionable recommendations. It checks everything from kernel
                                    parameters to file permissions to SSH configuration. I run it quarterly on all

                                <p>One last tip: always test your firewall rules before applying them permanently,
                                    especially on remote servers. Lock yourself out of your own server by accident
                                    and you will have a very bad day. Use <code>at</code> command to schedule a rule
                                    flush as a safety net while testing: if you get locked out, the rules reset
                                    automatically after a few minutes.</p>

                        <p>Handing over your email and system to an AI entirely... is that really a good idea?</p>
                        <div class="blog-excerpt">

                                <p>I honestly do not know if giving an AI chatbot full access to your emails and system
                                    is the smartest move. These bots are supposed to help you manage tasks, filter
                                    emails, and automate workflows. But the tradeoff is that you are feeding your entire
                                    digital life into a system you do not fully control or understand.</p>
                                <p>What happens when it misinterprets something? What if it auto-replies to an important
                                    email with garbage? What if the company behind it gets breached? Your entire
                                    communication history is sitting on their servers.</p>
                                <p>I am not saying AI assistants are useless. They have their place. But there is a
                                    difference between using AI as a tool you control and surrendering your entire
                                    workflow to it. Personally, I prefer to keep humans in the loop for anything
                                    important. Call me old school but I would rather spend five minutes reading my own
                                    emails than let an AI decide what matters.</p>
                                <p>The security implications are also worth thinking about. These bots need API access
                                    to your email, calendar, contacts, and sometimes even your file system. That is a
                                    massive attack surface. If the bot's API keys get compromised, the attacker has
                                    access to everything the bot has access to. And we have seen plenty of API key
                                    leaks in recent years.</p>

                        <p>How traffic analysis and timing attacks can de-anonymize Tor users.</p>
                        <div class="blog-excerpt">
                            <div class="blog-content">
                                <p>Correlation attacks are one of the most effective techniques against Tor. The idea is
                                    simple: if an adversary can observe traffic entering the Tor network and traffic
                                    exiting it, they can correlate the timing and volume patterns to link the two. No
                                    cryptography needs to be broken.</p>
                                <p>This requires a global passive adversary, one who can monitor many network points
                                    simultaneously. This is within the capability of nation-state intelligence agencies.
                                    Research has shown that with enough guard and exit relay monitoring,
                                    de-anonymization rates can be surprisingly high.</p>
                                <p>Mitigations include traffic padding, which adds dummy traffic to obscure patterns.
                                    Vanguards protect guard relay selection. Using bridges hides the fact that you are
                                    using Tor at all. But none of these are perfect. The fundamental weakness of
                                    low-latency anonymity networks is that they must preserve timing for usability,
                                    which inherently leaks information.</p>
                                <p>Academic research like the NetFlow analysis paper from 2024 showed that with access
                                    to ISP-level flow data, Tor users could be de-anonymized with concerning accuracy.
                                    The Tor Project responded with improvements, but the fundamental tension between
                                    usability and anonymity remains. If you need high-assurance anonymity, Tor alone
                                    is not enough. You need a comprehensive OPSEC strategy that accounts for behavioral
                                    patterns, timing habits, and metadata beyond just network traffic.</p>
