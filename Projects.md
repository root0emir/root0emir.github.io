Hardened Slarpx  Status: Active 2026-1-24

Catagory:  Security 
Desktop: None
Based On: Debian
First Public Release: 2026-1-24

Hardened Slarpx is a Debian-based Linux distribution built with a strict security-first approach. It uses a multi-layered defense model with aggressive mitigations and extensive kernel-level hardening. Due to its highly restrictive firewall policy, anonymization tools and certain network protocols are intentionally unsupported.The distribution includes two custom security modules: Poison and Xennytsu. Poison disrupts the deterministic timing required by exploit code by injecting random delays when abnormal behavior is detected, reducing the reliability of timing-based attacks. Xennytsu activates if an attacker gains a shell or attempts memory manipulation, detecting such activity within approximately 250 milliseconds and immediately terminating the offending process. Beyond passive hardening, Slarpx focuses on active intervention, sabotage, and destruction of attack paths when necessary.
